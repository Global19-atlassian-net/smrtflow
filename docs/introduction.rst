Introduction
============

This document describes the SMRT Link Web Services API provided by Pacific Biosciences.
The API allows developers to design and qc instrument runs, query new data from the instrument, and start analyses on the data.

The Web Services support RESTful access from web clients, and can be used from the command line with wget or curl,
and from programming languages, such as Python, or Scala.
