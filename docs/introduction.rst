This document describes the SMRT Link Web Services API provided by Pacific Biosciences.
The API allows developers to design and qc instrument runs, query new data from the instrument, and start analyses on the data.

The Web Services support RESTful access from web clients, and can be used from the command line with wget or curl,

The API includes functions for:

The Web Services APIs:

-  Run in or under a standard Linux/Apache environment, and can be accessed from Windows, Mac OS or Linux operating systems.
