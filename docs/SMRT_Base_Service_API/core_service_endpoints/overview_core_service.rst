========================

Use Cases
---------

The Core Service is the service that provides metadata about each util service that is loaded,
and monitors the util services that are loaded.

It also is the central hub where subsystem-to-subsystem communication occurs.

The Core Service includes endpoints that return the system status, configuration, and list of components.

The Core Service is accessible from the root of the application server.
