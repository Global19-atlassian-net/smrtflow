# Database (SQLite + Flyway + Slick)

See [smrtflow.readthedocs.io](http://smrtflow.readthedocs.io/) for full docs and [smrtflow](../README.md) for the base multi-project's README. 

A project for abstracting the database from our greater codebase, 
enforcing expected usage and adding support for convenient debugging and 
timing of all DB use. This all ends up being exposed as a single `RDMS`
class.

## Usage

There are three main use cases supported here: production, testing and
debugging/profiling.


### Production

```scala
```

### Testing

```scala
```

### Debugging and Profiling
